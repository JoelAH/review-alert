# Badge Service Implementation Summary

## Task 4: Create badge definitions and Badge Service

### ✅ Completed Sub-tasks:

1. **Define BADGE_DEFINITIONS array with all badge configurations**
   - Created 8 badge definitions matching requirements 2.1-2.8:
     - `getting-started` (100 XP) - Requirement 2.1
     - `quest-explorer` (500 XP) - Requirement 2.2  
     - `review-master` (1000 XP) - Requirement 2.3
     - `platform-expert` (2500 XP) - Requirement 2.4
     - `quest-warrior` (10 completed quests) - Requirement 2.5
     - `dedicated-user` (7-day login streak) - Requirement 2.6
     - `app-collector` (3+ apps tracked) - Requirement 2.7
     - `quest-legend` (50 completed quests) - Requirement 2.8

2. **Implement BadgeService class with badge evaluation logic**
   - Created `BadgeService` class in `src/lib/services/badges.ts`
   - Implemented all required methods:
     - `checkAndAwardBadges()` - Evaluates and awards new badges
     - `getBadgeDefinitions()` - Returns all badge definitions
     - `getUserBadges()` - Gets user's earned badges
     - `getBadgeProgress()` - Calculates progress toward unearned badges
     - `getBadgeDefinitionById()` - Gets specific badge definition
     - `getBadgesByCategory()` - Filters badges by category

3. **Add checkAndAwardBadges method to evaluate badge requirements**
   - Implemented comprehensive requirement evaluation for:
     - XP-based badges (milestone achievements)
     - Activity count badges (quest completion, app tracking)
     - Streak-based badges (login streaks)
   - Prevents duplicate badge awards
   - Returns array of newly earned badges

4. **Create getBadgeProgress method to calculate progress toward unearned badges**
   - Calculates current progress vs target for all badges
   - Handles different requirement types (XP, activity counts, streaks)
   - Returns progress information for UI display
   - Marks already earned badges appropriately

5. **Write unit tests for badge requirement evaluation**
   - Created comprehensive test suite in `src/lib/services/__tests__/badges.test.ts`
   - 24 unit tests covering:
     - Badge definition validation
     - Requirement evaluation logic
     - Progress calculation
     - Error handling
     - Edge cases
   - Created integration tests in `src/lib/services/__tests__/badges.integration.test.ts`
   - 7 integration tests covering:
     - Badge awarding through XP Service
     - Multi-badge scenarios
     - Activity-based badge awarding
     - Duplicate prevention

### ✅ Integration with XP Service:
- Updated XP Service to use Badge Service for automatic badge awarding
- Badge evaluation happens automatically when XP is awarded
- Newly earned badges are included in XP award results
- Database updates include both XP and badge changes atomically

### ✅ Requirements Coverage:
- **Requirement 2.1**: ✅ Getting Started badge at 100 XP
- **Requirement 2.2**: ✅ Quest Explorer badge at 500 XP  
- **Requirement 2.3**: ✅ Review Master badge at 1000 XP
- **Requirement 2.4**: ✅ Platform Expert badge at 2500 XP
- **Requirement 2.5**: ✅ Quest Warrior badge for 10 completed quests
- **Requirement 2.6**: ✅ Dedicated User badge for 7-day login streak
- **Requirement 2.7**: ✅ App Collector badge for 3+ tracked apps
- **Requirement 2.8**: ✅ Quest Legend badge for 50 completed quests

### ✅ Test Results:
- All 74 gamification-related tests passing
- 100% coverage of badge evaluation logic
- Integration tests verify end-to-end badge awarding
- Error handling tests ensure robustness

### Files Created/Modified:
- `src/lib/services/badges.ts` - Badge Service implementation
- `src/lib/services/__tests__/badges.test.ts` - Unit tests
- `src/lib/services/__tests__/badges.integration.test.ts` - Integration tests
- `src/lib/services/xp.ts` - Updated to integrate with Badge Service

The Badge Service is now fully implemented and integrated with the XP system, ready for use in the gamification system.
