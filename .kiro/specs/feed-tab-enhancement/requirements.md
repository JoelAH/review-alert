# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Feed Tab Enhancement feature will transform the current mock-based feed tab into a fully functional review monitoring system. Users will be able to view all their app reviews from multiple stores (Google Play, Apple App Store, Chrome Web Store) in a unified, filterable, and efficiently loaded interface. The enhancement will include visual indicators for review sentiment, quest types, and priority levels, along with proper data fetching from the database using the user's session UID.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an app developer, I want to see all my app reviews from different stores in one centralized feed, so that I can monitor user feedback efficiently without switching between platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the Feed tab THEN the system SHALL fetch and display all reviews associated with the user's UID from the database
2. WHEN reviews are displayed THEN each review SHALL show the app name, reviewer name, review date, rating, and comment text
3. WHEN reviews are displayed THEN each review SHALL include a platform icon (Google Play, Apple App Store, or Chrome Web Store) to indicate the source store
4. WHEN no reviews exist for a user THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an app developer, I want to see visual indicators for review sentiment, quest type, and priority, so that I can quickly identify important reviews that need attention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a review has sentiment data THEN the system SHALL display appropriate visual indicators (colors or icons) for positive or negative sentiment without using excessive text
2. WHEN a review has quest data THEN the system SHALL display appropriate icons or symbols for bug reports, feature requests, or other categories
3. WHEN a review has priority data THEN the system SHALL display appropriate visual indicators (colors or symbols) for high, medium, or low priority levels
4. WHEN visual indicators are displayed THEN they SHALL be space-efficient and not overwhelm the review content

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an app developer, I want to filter my reviews by different criteria, so that I can focus on specific types of feedback or platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the feed tab loads THEN the system SHALL provide filter options at the top of the interface
2. WHEN filters are available THEN users SHALL be able to filter by platform (Google Play, Apple App Store, Chrome Web Store)
3. WHEN filters are available THEN users SHALL be able to filter by star rating
4. WHEN filters are applied THEN the review list SHALL update to show only matching reviews
5. WHEN filters are cleared THEN the system SHALL return to showing all reviews

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an app developer with many reviews, I want the review list to load efficiently with lazy loading or scroll loading, so that the interface remains responsive even with large amounts of data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the feed tab loads THEN the system SHALL implement efficient loading to handle large numbers of reviews
2. WHEN a user scrolls to the bottom of the review list THEN the system SHALL automatically load additional reviews if available
3. WHEN reviews are being loaded THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading indicators
4. WHEN all reviews have been loaded THEN the system SHALL indicate that no more reviews are available

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an app developer, I want to see an overview section with sentiment and quest type breakdowns, so that I can quickly understand the overall health and common themes in my app reviews.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the feed tab loads THEN the system SHALL display an overview section at the top showing sentiment breakdown (positive, neutral, negative counts)
2. WHEN the overview section is displayed THEN it SHALL show the distribution of reviews across different platforms (Google Play, Apple App Store, Chrome Web Store) with percentages
3. WHEN the overview section is displayed THEN it SHALL include a visual chart or breakdown of sentiment analysis
4. WHEN quest type data is available THEN the overview SHALL show common quest categories (bug reports, feature requests, other) with their frequencies
5. WHEN the overview section is displayed THEN it SHALL be visually distinct from the review list and provide actionable insights

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an app developer, I want each review to be displayed in a consistent, reusable card format, so that the interface is clean and maintainable for future updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviews are displayed THEN each review SHALL use a consistent card component design
2. WHEN the review card component is created THEN it SHALL be reusable and easily updatable for future enhancements
3. WHEN review cards are displayed THEN they SHALL be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices
4. WHEN review cards are displayed THEN they SHALL include hover effects or visual feedback for better user experience
