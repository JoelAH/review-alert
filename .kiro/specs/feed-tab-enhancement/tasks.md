  - Implement sentiment filter with options for All, Positive, and Negative
  - Add quest type filter with options for All, Bug Reports, Feature Requests, and Other
  - Include search functionality for filtering reviews by content
  - Ensure filters trigger callback functions to update the parent component state
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 5. Implement data fetching logic with pagination and filtering
  - Create custom hook or service function for fetching reviews from the API endpoint
  - Implement pagination state management with page tracking and hasMore flag
  - Add filter state management for platform, rating, sentiment, and quest filters
  - Implement debounced API calls to optimize performance when filters change
  - Add loading states and error handling for API requests
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.4, 4.1, 4.3_

- [x] 6. Enhance FeedTab component with new functionality
  - Integrate ReviewOverview component at the top of the FeedTab
  - Replace mock data with real API calls using the user's UID from Firebase auth
  - Implement ReviewFilters component and connect filter state to API calls
  - Replace existing review display with new ReviewCard components
  - Add infinite scroll or "Load More" functionality for pagination
  - Implement loading indicators and empty states for different scenarios
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 4.2, 4.4_

- [x] 7. Add comprehensive error handling and loading states
  - Implement error boundaries and error handling for API failures
  - Add skeleton loaders for initial data loading and pagination loading
  - Create appropriate empty states for no reviews, no filtered results, and unauthenticated users
  - Add toast notifications for error scenarios using existing React Toastify setup
  - Implement retry mechanisms for failed API requests
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 8. Write comprehensive tests for all components
  - Create unit tests for ReviewCard component with different review data scenarios
  - Write tests for ReviewOverview component calculations and display logic
  - Implement tests for ReviewFilters component state management and callbacks
  - Add integration tests for FeedTab component data flow from API to UI
  - Create tests for the API route including authentication, filtering, and pagination
  - Write accessibility tests to ensure keyboard navigation and screen reader support
  - _Requirements: 6.2, 6.3, 6.4_

- [x] 9. Optimize performance and implement caching
  - Add React.memo optimization to ReviewCard components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Implement client-side caching for recently fetched review data
  - Add debouncing to filter changes to reduce API call frequency
  - Optimize database queries and leverage existing indexes for better performance
  - Consider virtual scrolling implementation for very large review lists
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 10. Final integration and responsive design testing
  - Test complete functionality across different screen sizes and devices
  - Verify all visual indicators display correctly with proper tooltips
  - Ensure all filters work correctly and update the review list appropriately
  - Test infinite scroll or pagination functionality with large datasets
  - Validate that authentication integration works properly with user-specific data
  - Perform final accessibility testing and WCAG compliance verification
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4_
