# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds email-based authentication to the Review Alert application, complementing the existing Google OAuth system. Users will be able to create accounts and sign in using their email address and password, providing an alternative authentication method for users who prefer not to use Google OAuth or don't have Google accounts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to create an account using my email address and password, so that I can access the Review Alert platform without requiring a Google account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the signup page THEN the system SHALL display a form with email and password fields
2. WHEN a user enters a valid email address THEN the system SHALL accept the email format
3. WHEN a user enters an invalid email format THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN a user enters a disposable/temporary email address THEN the system SHALL reject the email and display an error message
5. WHEN a user enters a password with less than 8 characters THEN the system SHALL display a password strength error
6. WHEN a user successfully submits valid credentials THEN the system SHALL create a new user account in Firebase Auth
7. WHEN account creation is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the dashboard

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an existing user with an email account, I want to sign in using my email and password, so that I can access my dashboard and tracked applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the login page THEN the system SHALL display a form with email and password fields
2. WHEN a user enters valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user through Firebase Auth
3. WHEN a user enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the dashboard
5. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL keep the user on the login page with error feedback

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access both Google OAuth and email authentication options from both signup and login pages, so that I can choose my preferred authentication method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is on the signup page THEN the system SHALL display both Google OAuth and email signup options
2. WHEN a user is on the login page THEN the system SHALL display both Google OAuth and email login options
3. WHEN a user clicks the Google OAuth button THEN the system SHALL initiate the existing Google authentication flow
4. WHEN a user has an account with one method THEN the system SHALL allow them to link the other authentication method
5. WHEN a user navigates between signup and login pages THEN the system SHALL provide clear navigation links

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the signup and login pages to have a clean, simple design consistent with the existing application, so that the authentication experience feels integrated and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the authentication pages THEN the system SHALL use the existing MUI theme and styling
2. WHEN a user interacts with form elements THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback for validation states
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages using the existing toast notification system
4. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display a responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
5. WHEN a user is on an authentication page THEN the system SHALL display the Review Alert branding consistently

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want email validation to prevent abuse from disposable email services, so that we maintain a quality user base and reduce spam accounts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits an email during signup THEN the system SHALL validate against a list of known disposable email domains
2. WHEN a disposable email is detected THEN the system SHALL reject the signup with a clear error message
3. WHEN a valid email domain is used THEN the system SHALL proceed with account creation
4. WHEN email validation occurs THEN the system SHALL not block legitimate email providers
5. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL log the attempt for monitoring purposes
