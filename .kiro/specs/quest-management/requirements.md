# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Quest Management feature enables users to create actionable tasks (quests) directly from app store reviews. This feature transforms review feedback into trackable work items with states, priorities, and detailed information. Users can create quests from any review card, manage quest states through a dedicated quest tab, and organize their work based on priority and completion status.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer monitoring app reviews, I want to create a quest from any review, so that I can track actionable items that need to be addressed based on user feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a review card THEN the system SHALL display a "Create Quest" button on each review card
2. WHEN a user clicks the "Create Quest" button THEN the system SHALL open a modal dialog for quest creation
3. WHEN the quest creation modal opens THEN the system SHALL pre-populate relevant fields with review information (title suggestions, review content in details)
4. WHEN a user fills out quest information THEN the system SHALL require a title, allow optional details, quest type selection, and priority selection
5. WHEN a user submits a valid quest THEN the system SHALL create the quest and close the modal
6. WHEN a quest is created THEN the system SHALL associate it with the originating review

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer managing multiple quests, I want to view all my quests in a dedicated quest tab, so that I can see all actionable items in one organized location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the quest tab THEN the system SHALL display all quests for the current user
2. WHEN displaying quests THEN the system SHALL show quest cards with title, details, type, priority, and current state
3. WHEN displaying quests THEN the system SHALL sort quests first by state (open, in progress, done) then by priority (high, medium, low)
4. WHEN no quests exist THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message
5. WHEN quests are loading THEN the system SHALL display loading indicators

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working on quests, I want to change quest states between open, in progress, and done, so that I can track my progress on different tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a quest card THEN the system SHALL display a state selector dropdown
2. WHEN a user clicks the state selector THEN the system SHALL show options for "Open", "In Progress", and "Done"
3. WHEN a user selects a new state THEN the system SHALL update the quest state immediately
4. WHEN a quest state changes THEN the system SHALL update the visual indicator (color coding) on the quest card
5. WHEN quest states are updated THEN the system SHALL re-sort the quest list automatically
6. IF a state update fails THEN the system SHALL revert to the previous state and show an error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer organizing my work, I want quests to have visual indicators for their state and priority, so that I can quickly identify what needs attention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying quest cards THEN the system SHALL use distinct colors to indicate quest states (e.g., blue for open, yellow for in progress, green for done)
2. WHEN displaying quest cards THEN the system SHALL show priority levels with appropriate visual emphasis
3. WHEN displaying quest cards THEN the system SHALL include the quest type as a visible label or badge
4. WHEN displaying quest cards THEN the system SHALL show the associated review information or link back to the original review
5. WHEN quest cards are displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent visual hierarchy and readability

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer using the quest system, I want quest data to be properly stored and retrieved, so that my quests persist across sessions and are reliably available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a quest is created THEN the system SHALL store it in the database with all required fields
2. WHEN quest states are updated THEN the system SHALL persist the changes to the database
3. WHEN a user loads the quest tab THEN the system SHALL retrieve quests from the database efficiently
4. WHEN quests are retrieved THEN the system SHALL include associated review information
5. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and inform the user
6. WHEN a user has multiple apps THEN the system SHALL scope quests appropriately to the user's apps

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer managing quests, I want to edit quest details after creation, so that I can update information as my understanding of the task evolves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a quest card THEN the system SHALL provide an option to edit quest details
2. WHEN a user chooses to edit a quest THEN the system SHALL open an edit modal with current quest information
3. WHEN editing a quest THEN the system SHALL allow modification of title, details, type, and priority
4. WHEN a user saves quest edits THEN the system SHALL update the quest and refresh the display
5. WHEN a user cancels quest editing THEN the system SHALL discard changes and close the edit modal
